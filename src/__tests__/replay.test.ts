// Records someone already keeps, played back through the app before anyone uses it: a template and the rows a
// person would paste into it (`template.md` and `rows.tsv` — the first row naming the columns, one column the day
// each record was made) in the directory `LOWLINE_REPLAY` names. The rows are brought in the way the app brings
// them in; the first `LOWLINE_REPLAY_BROUGHT_IN_WEEKS` weeks of them all at the start, as a person who imports
// their history would, the rest one by one on the day they were made. The sidecar is asked about each later
// record field by field and the record saved with what it says (`ReplayTests.cs`); what was offered becomes the
// events a save records, and those the weekly counts a person would hand over. Everything is written to
// `LOWLINE_REPLAY_OUT` (default: a folder in the temp directory) — the rows never leave this machine, only what
// the counts say. Records that name documents of another template (`@업소 -> food-business`) come with that template
// and its rows in `base/`, in the same shape: those are brought in first and whole, as a person brings in their
// businesses before the inspections that name them, and the records' reference cells are resolved to them the way
// the app resolves pasted names. Runs only when `LOWLINE_REPLAY` is set; needs `dotnet`.
